## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-16

### Added

- Initial release of Flutter Compositions
- Core reactivity system powered by `alien_signals`
- `CompositionWidget` base class for creating reactive widgets
- Reactive primitives: `ref`, `computed`, `writableComputed`, `untracked`
- Side effect APIs: `watch`, `watchEffect`
- Lifecycle hooks: `onMounted`, `onUnmounted`, `onBuild`
- Dependency injection: `provide`, `inject`, `InjectionKey`
- Reactive props access via `widget()`
- **Hot reload support**: `setup()` re-executes during hot reload to pick up code changes
- **Automatic hot reload state preservation**: `ref()` values are automatically preserved during hot reload based on their position in `setup()` - no manual configuration needed, similar to flutter_hooks
- Built-in composables:
  - Controllers: `useScrollController`, `useTextEditingController`, `usePageController`, `useFocusNode`
  - Animations: `useAnimationController`, `useSingleTickerProvider`, `manageAnimation`
  - Async: `useFuture`, `useAsyncData`, `useStream`, `useStreamController`, `useAsyncValue`
  - Framework: `useContext`, `useAppLifecycleState`, `useSearchController`
  - Listenable: `manageListenable`, `manageValueListenable`, `manageChangeNotifier`
- AsyncValue sealed class for type-safe async state handling with pattern matching
- Custom ref: `customRef`, `ReadonlyCustomRef`
